# WearableSMS
Under development
Idea:
  Enable quick respond message on wearable watch (Moto 360 - Gen1, used in dev).
  New messages will be parsed with all previously recived SMS and find simularities, 
  when simmular message is found it check what you responded at that time and put that in an array of possible answers.
